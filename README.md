# qtcreeper

##Requires
* Python 2.7, https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
* python-requests module, which is included for convenience, but deleting it and installing it via Python's pip install tool might be better if you know how

##Windows installation instructions for noobs
* Install Python 2.7 (*not* version 3), https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi (link to 32 bit version but will probably work on all systems)
* In the qtcreeper github, click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" to download all necessary files
* Extract ZIP file
* Double click qtcreeper.py to run

##Misc notes
* On running qtcreeper you will be prompted to specify your username/password and the type of qts to search for, this will be saved across launches
* Settings data (config and list of already visited qts) is stored in a .qtcreeper folder in your home directory (something like C:\\Users\\<Username>\\.qtcreeper\\ on windows)
